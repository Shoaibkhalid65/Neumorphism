# üßä Neumorphism + Material 3 Expressive Components in Jetpack Compose

**Neumorphism**, also known as *Soft UI*, is a modern visual design trend that blends elements of **skeuomorphism** and **flat design**. It uses subtle highlights and shadows to create depth, giving UI components a soft, extruded appearance. The style is minimalistic and tactile, often using monochromatic color schemes with low-contrast lighting.

This project demonstrates the use of **Material 3 Expressive components** within a **Neumorphic UI** built using Jetpack Compose.
